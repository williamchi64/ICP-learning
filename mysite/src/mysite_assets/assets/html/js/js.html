        <h1>What is JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
            While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, 
                Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, 
                supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. 
            This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. 
            For information about API specifics to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
            The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). 
            The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. 
            And in cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features.
            Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. 
            However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.

        <h1>Strict mode in JS</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript's strict mode, introduced in ECMAScript 5, is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, 
                thereby implicitly opting-out of "sloppy mode". 
            Strict mode isn't just a subset: it intentionally has different semantics from normal code. 
            Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, 
                so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode. 
            Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist, so scripts can opt into strict mode incrementally.
            <div>
                Several situations with strict mode on JS: 
                <h2>Strict mode for scripts</h2>
                <p>
                    // Whole-script strict mode syntax, should claim on the beginning of the script.<br />
                    'use strict';<br />
                    var v = "Hi! I'm a strict mode script!";
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Strict mode for functions</h2>
                <p>
                    function strict() {<br />
                    &emsp;// Function-level strict mode syntax<br />
                    &emsp;'use strict';<br />
                    &emsp;function nested() { return 'And so am I!'; }<br />
                    &emsp;return "Hi!  I'm a strict mode function!  " + nested();<br />
                    }<br />
                    function notStrict() { return "I'm not strict."; }
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Strict mode for modules</h2>
                <p>
                    function strict() {<br />
                    &emsp;// because this is a module, I'm strict by default<br />
                    }<br />
                    export default strict;
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Strict mode for classes</h2>
                <p>
                    All parts of ECMAScript classes are strict mode code, 
                        including both class declarations and class expressions â€” and so also including all parts of class bodies.
